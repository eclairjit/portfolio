2. Develop a responsive design to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices.

## Features

1. **Appealing UI:**

- Incorporated Ascertinity UI components for visually appealing design

2. **Pokemon Search**

- Users can search names of their favourite Pokémon and will be redirected to a separate page where the details about that specific Pokémon will be displayed.
- Used the PokeAPI for fetching data about Pokémons

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** [react](https://react.dev/) for a dynamic and responsive user interface and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

## Outcome

This implementation of the Pokédex gives a feel of the actual Pokédex which people might have watched during their childhood. A lot of work is still left, more featured are to be added to make it fully functioning. I'm working on it.
